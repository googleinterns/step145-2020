# An index must be made and deployed before preforming a complex query.
# Complex queries are queries on more than one property.
# A index can be deployed by performing the command below.
# gcloud datastore indexes create ./src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/index.yaml
# Preforming a query without previously deploying an index will cause a DatastoreNeedIndexException.
# See links below for more information on constructing indexes and query restrictions.
